- This is a symmetrical power supply whose output can be adjusted up to +15V and -15V, thus 
this power supply should be used with a adjustable power supply up to 30V at its input.
- The maximum output current is 5A.
- If the input voltage is greater than 30V, the fuse will blow for protection.

- I added the gerbers files of PCB. The files were made in Kicad software.
- The .pdf files are the schematic and pcb layout.
